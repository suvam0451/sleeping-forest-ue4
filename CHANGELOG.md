# Change Log

## [0.6.14]

There were a lot of disorganized snippets/functions/headerpacks added since last update. Maintaining and updating the wiki
for them would have been very difficult...  So, I came up with multiple scripts that will read 
this repo directly and update the documentation on the fly through the CI.

Over the next few days, I will get that up running and make sure that reasonable docstrings are getting generated for every snippet.

To preview how that would look like, heres the generated page for [uprop](http://localhost:8000/docs/sleeping-forest/snippet-lists/uprop)

- **WARNING** : The texture packer will be unavailable for a few days since I made some changes to the API.
I will add it along-with the documentation.

- FEATURE : BP implementable event accessible via `ufunc_bpevent`(BP)
- FEATURE : I am now bundling microservice binaries for linux and macos as well.
I will add the support tutorials to use the CLI directly, but expect the platform support in alater date.

- FIX : If the function is two tabs away, body doesn't get generated.
- FIX : Struct functions definitions are now properly generated.
- FIX : If code was formatted using uncoventional setting, function generator would break down.
- FIX : Function body not being generated for two tabs (UE4 style default)

## [0.6.13] - 7 March 2020

- PI values for .usf files similarily provide dropdowns for PI, 2PI, PI/2.
- Logo update
- Included most nodes covered by YT series by M. Wadstein. Exclusions listen in snippets/usf/MissingNodes.md
- Experimental grammar support for usf files.

### Feature update

- Removed `uprop_xyz_arr` and `uprop_xyz_adv` snippets.
- You get a dropdown instead asking you for single/array/map properties.
- Similarily, `udebug_line`, `udebug_sphere`, `udebug_point` now just ask you for the FPS instead of having separate snippets for each FPS.
- You can now cycle through the properties _(snippet generated)_ like this using snippets.

## [0.6.8] - 17 Feb 2020

- Oh my god !!! Did I just forget to break a switch statement ? _smh_.
- Remember to run context again on generated function body to add code to source file guys <3.
- Sidenote : Always make sure you exit switch statements !!!

## [0.6.7] - 17 Feb 2020

---

- Removed complicated settings. Edits made to the **.code-workspace** file is now fully customizable by you using `SF.excludeFolders`, `SF.searchExclude`, `SF.excludedExtensions`.
- This means, unless you are working on Editor extensions, you get best results using the default settings itself.
- Patched a bug where Context won't activate with components with default values in header

### Feature Updates:

- Added `UE4 : Add Override function`. Helps adding { OnConstruction, Tick, BeginPlay etc.}
- Also **supports context key**. Activates from lines with { public: , private: , protected: } in header.
- Can be extended with `Functions_Ext.json` in sidebar. See `Functions_Core.json`(ReadOnly) for default list.
- Added `SF.excludeFolders`, `SF.searchExclude`, `SF.excludedExtensions` for more control.
- Removed `SF.allowUserExtensions`. Modding support is always on from now.
